### Algorithmic Approach
The algorithm chose was [BFS] (Breadth-First Search)
This approach check all possibilities derived from the current state
It receives the BFS name due to checking every possibility in the current layer before going in depth

#### Test cases for validation
The testing cases ensures the core logic is working through testing small units of code.
Currently the main method being tested is the [Calculate]
This method receives 3 [int] values and ensures they meet the requirements for the BFS algorithm to execute
Our testing covers successful, failure and edge cases to ensure the application doesn't break.

##### Instructions to run the program
This application is made using the [Flutter] sdk within the [Dart] language.

[Steps to run]:
    [1] - Download the <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter SDK</a> accordingly to your Operation System

    [3] - Add the Flutter path to your Environment Variables
    [4] - Clone the project using Git clone
    [5] - Open the project using your favorite IDE
    [6] - Install the Flutter plugin
    [7] - Run the project through your IDE or using the command line flutter run (optionally pass the platform argument)
